# Contributing to SymLogos

We welcome contributions to SymLogos! Here's a guide on how to participate in the project:

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or want to request a new feature, please [create an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/SymLogos/issues/new) on GitHub. When reporting a bug, please include a detailed description, steps to reproduce the issue, and any relevant error messages or logs.

## Contributing Code

1. Fork the SymLogos repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Develop and test your changes in your branch.
4. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding style and guidelines.
5. Commit your changes, push your branch to your fork, and create a pull request against the main SymLogos repository.

## Code Review and Merging

Once you have submitted a pull request, the SymLogos maintainers will review your code. If any changes or improvements are necessary, they will provide feedback and request changes. After all changes have been made and your pull request is approved, your code will be merged into the main repository.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to SymLogos and look forward to working together!
